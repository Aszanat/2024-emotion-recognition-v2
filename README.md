# Emotion and sentiment recognition

## Introduction
Understanding human emotions is one of the more challenging tasks in natural language processing. Not only are they a very subjective topic, but humans also often lack the capability to fully express themselves in written language. Understanding the expressed emotions can require some additional context, sometimes given by external knowledge.

Nowadays, the problem of understanding the structure and subtleties of a language as well as having knowledge that is not available in the immediate context of a text is addressed by using large pre-trained models. This solution is by no means perfect and often requires additional training to fit the task at hand. Nonetheless, having associative knowledge from a lot of unlabeled texts gives noticeable gains in tasks such as emotion recognition.
